# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-31)

**Core value:** A note dropped on a page reliably becomes a precise, context-rich .md file on disk in the right project's notes/ folder — never silently lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Scaffold & Clean-Room Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2
Plan: Not started
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: SW-as-sole-HTTP-client boundary is the single riskiest invariant — proven with a dummy relay in Phase 3 before any real note UI ships
- [Pre-phase]: DPR-correct crop + double-rAF flush + captureVisibleTab relay are a reusable trio built once in Phase 4, inherited by Phases 5 and 6
- [Pre-phase]: GPL clean-room hygiene (sfx-* identifiers, @medv/finder, zero upstream text) enforced from Phase 1, not a pre-release checklist

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- React fiber property names (`__reactFiber`) are internal APIs — plan for graceful omission in Phase 5 if detection fails
- `interactjs` drag-marquee inside shadow DOM `context` option is not extensively tested in WXT contexts — budget exploration time in Phase 6 planning
- Windows 125% DPR (fractional) crop correctness requires `Math.round` after multiply — must be tested on developer's machine in Phase 4
