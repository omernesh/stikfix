# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-31)

**Core value:** A note dropped on a page reliably becomes a precise, context-rich .md file on disk in the right project's notes/ folder — never silently lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — Host MVP

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (Host MVP) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3
Status: Executing Phase 02
Last activity: 2026-05-31 -- Phase 02-01 complete (4 tasks, 26 tests, 4 commits)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 17%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: SW-as-sole-HTTP-client boundary is the single riskiest invariant — proven with a dummy relay in Phase 3 before any real note UI ships
- [Pre-phase]: DPR-correct crop + double-rAF flush + captureVisibleTab relay are a reusable trio built once in Phase 4, inherited by Phases 5 and 6
- [Pre-phase]: GPL clean-room hygiene (sfx-* identifiers, @medv/finder, zero upstream text) enforced from Phase 1, not a pre-release checklist
- [02-01]: tsconfig.host.json rootDir changed from host/src to host — required to compile both host/src/**/*.ts and host/test/**/*.ts; compiled test paths use dist/host/test/ prefix
- [02-01]: writeNote takes serial as parameter (not calling getNextSerial internally) — keeps write-note.ts testable without mutex dependency; server wires them together in 02-02

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- React fiber property names (`__reactFiber`) are internal APIs — plan for graceful omission in Phase 5 if detection fails
- `interactjs` drag-marquee inside shadow DOM `context` option is not extensively tested in WXT contexts — budget exploration time in Phase 6 planning
- Windows 125% DPR (fractional) crop correctness requires `Math.round` after multiply — must be tested on developer's machine in Phase 4
