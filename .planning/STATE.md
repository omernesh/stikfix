# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-31)

**Core value:** A note dropped on a page reliably becomes a precise, context-rich .md file on disk in the right project's notes/ folder — never silently lost.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — Extension Skeleton + SW Relay Proof

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (Extension Skeleton + SW Relay Proof) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 4
Status: Phase complete — ready for verification
Last activity: 2026-05-31

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 22%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-phase]: SW-as-sole-HTTP-client boundary is the single riskiest invariant — proven with a dummy relay in Phase 3 before any real note UI ships
- [Pre-phase]: DPR-correct crop + double-rAF flush + captureVisibleTab relay are a reusable trio built once in Phase 4, inherited by Phases 5 and 6
- [Pre-phase]: GPL clean-room hygiene (sfx-* identifiers, @medv/finder, zero upstream text) enforced from Phase 1, not a pre-release checklist
- [02-01]: tsconfig.host.json rootDir changed from host/src to host — required to compile both host/src/**/*.ts and host/test/**/*.ts; compiled test paths use dist/host/test/ prefix
- [02-01]: writeNote takes serial as parameter (not calling getNextSerial internally) — keeps write-note.ts testable without mutex dependency; server wires them together in 02-02
- [02-02]: createHostServer does not call listen — factory stays testable with ephemeral port 0 in integration tests
- [02-02]: setCorsHeaders called first in every handler branch (before writeHead/end) — ensures 401/413/404 carry CORS headers so browser can read error bodies (Pitfall 6)
- [Phase ?]: body.file from POST /annotation is absolute path (writeNote returns mdPath directly) — use existsSync(body.file) without notesDir join
- [Phase ?]: smoke test asserts port in 39240-39260, 401 no-token, token POST + .md-on-disk — full end-to-end HOST-01-05 coverage
- [Phase ?]: lib/types.ts SFX_MSG constants use uppercase snake (SFX_ENTER_REVIEW etc.) exported as const object — downstream plans import this object not the string literals
- [Phase ?]: tsconfig.lib.json rootDir=. yields dist/lib/lib/* double-nested output; package.json test:lib references dist/lib/lib/test/*.js
- [Phase ?]: A4 CSS auto-inject deferred to Plan 03-04 first build; scripting.insertCSS fallback pre-authorized in background.ts
- [Phase ?]: chrome.scripting used for executeScript files:[] — WXT browser.scripting restricts to ScriptPublicPath[]
- [Phase ?]: WXT auto-injects CSS into shadow root for runtime content scripts
- [Phase ?]: Added SW echo handler so content scripts can discover their own tabId

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- React fiber property names (`__reactFiber`) are internal APIs — plan for graceful omission in Phase 5 if detection fails
- `interactjs` drag-marquee inside shadow DOM `context` option is not extensively tested in WXT contexts — budget exploration time in Phase 6 planning
- Windows 125% DPR (fractional) crop correctness requires `Math.round` after multiply — must be tested on developer's machine in Phase 4
