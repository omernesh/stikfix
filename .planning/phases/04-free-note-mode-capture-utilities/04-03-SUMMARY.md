# Phase 4 Plan 3: SW Capture Relay — handleCaptureTab + SFX_CAPTURE_TAB Summary

**SW becomes the sole `captureVisibleTab` caller via a new `handleCaptureTab` handler and `case SFX_CAPTURE_TAB:` router branch — anti-spoof windowId derivation from `chrome.tabs.get`, async `return true` channel kept open, D-06 free-note isolation honored.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~8 min
- **Started:** 2026-05-31
- **Completed:** 2026-05-31
- **Tasks:** 1 of 2 completed (Task 2 awaits human integration proof)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- `handleCaptureTab(tabId)` added to background.ts — derives `windowId` from `chrome.tabs.get`, calls `captureVisibleTab`, returns `{ ok, dataUrl }`
- `SFX_CAPTURE_TAB` and `MsgCaptureTab` imported into background.ts from types.ts
- `case SFX_CAPTURE_TAB:` router branch added before `default:` with mandatory `return true`
- STRIDE threats T-04-07 (spoofing), T-04-08 (info disclosure), T-04-09 (EoP) mitigated by design
- `tsc --noEmit` x2 + `npm run build`: exit 0

## Task Commits

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | handleCaptureTab + SFX_CAPTURE_TAB router case | 496f4c8 | entrypoints/background.ts |
| 2 | Integration proof (manual) | PENDING — awaiting human verification | — |

## Files Created/Modified

- `entrypoints/background.ts` — added 36 lines: `handleCaptureTab` async function, updated import line (SFX_CAPTURE_TAB + MsgCaptureTab), extended router union signature, added `case SFX_CAPTURE_TAB:` branch

## Decisions Made

- `windowId` derived from `chrome.tabs.get(tabId)` not from the message body — a forged `windowId` from a content script cannot redirect the capture to an unintended window (T-04-07).
- `captureVisibleTab` appears exactly once in the codebase (grep-verifiable invariant for T-04-09).
- Router case casts to `(msg as MsgCaptureTab).tabId` — same pattern as existing `MsgSetRoute`/`MsgGetTabId` local interfaces in background.ts.
- Free-note Send (`handleSendAnnotation`, `card.ts`) left completely untouched per D-06.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written for Task 1.

## Known Stubs

None. `handleCaptureTab` is fully implemented. The capture trio round-trip (captureTab → SW → captureVisibleTab → waitTwoRafs → cropToRect) cannot be verified automatically — it requires a live Chrome session.

## Threat Flags

None new. Mitigations verified in code:

| Threat | Mitigation | Verification |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| T-04-07 (Spoofing) | `windowId` from `chrome.tabs.get(tabId)`, never `msg.windowId` | grep: `captureVisibleTab(msg.` returns 0 matches |
| T-04-08 (Info Disclosure) | captureVisibleTab captures only active visible viewport; trio is standalone, not auto-fired | D-06 enforced: card.ts/handleSendAnnotation unchanged |
| T-04-09 (EoP) | captureVisibleTab appears exactly once, inside the SW handler | grep: exactly 1 actual call site in background.ts |

## Checkpoint: Task 2 — Human Integration Proof Required

Task 2 is a `checkpoint:human-verify` gate. The automated portion (Task 1 build + type-check) passed. The round-trip proof requires a live Chrome session:

**Steps:**
1. `npm run build` (done — exit 0), load/reload unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`
2. Start a host: `npm run host -- --root <test-dir>`, open any HTTPS page, enter Review Mode
3. From DevTools console, invoke the trio:
   - Hide shadow-root UI (`visibility:hidden`)
   - `await waitTwoRafs()`
   - `const url = await captureTab(tabId)` — expect `data:image/png;base64,...`
   - `const cropped = await cropToRect(url, {x:0,y:0,width:200,height:120}, window.devicePixelRatio)`
   - Restore UI (`visibility:''`)
4. Open the dataURL in a new tab — confirm real page pixels, NO stickyfix UI (chip/FAB) visible
5. Send a free note — verify written `.md` file has `screenshots: []`

**Acceptance:** captureTab → SW PNG dataUrl + own-UI absent + DPR-correct crop + free-note screenshots still [].
