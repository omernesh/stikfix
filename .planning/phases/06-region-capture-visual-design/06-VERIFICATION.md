# Phase 6: Region Capture + Visual Design + Persistent Pins — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Every note has a working camera tool (drag-marquee DPR-correct region crop + multiple deletable thumbnails); the entire injected UI has a polished paper-aesthetic sticky-note look inside shadow-DOM isolation; and every note left on a page reappears as a clickable on-page pin (rehydrated from disk via a new host read endpoint) that can be viewed, edited (overwrite in place), or deleted (file + screenshots).

**Verified:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification
**Mode:** mvp (compound technical goal — verified against the 6 explicit ROADMAP Success Criteria, which are the contract)

## Goal Achievement

### Success Criteria (ROADMAP contract)

| # | Success Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Camera tool dims page (scrim) + crosshair; Esc / sub-6px drag cancels | ✓ VERIFIED | `marquee.ts` `enterMarqueeMode` appends `.sfx-cam-scrim`, wires `interact.js`; Escape listener (line 57) calls cancel; `isBelowThreshold(r)` (line 92) cancels sub-6px. CSS `.sfx-cam-scrim` (styles.css:585). Crosshair via cam-mode class. Runtime-UAT confirmed. |
| 2 | Drag region → deletable thumbnail; 2nd drag → +2 | ✓ VERIFIED | `card.ts` capture path (220–243): `enterMarqueeMode` → `cropToRect` → `thumbnails.push({kind:'+N'})` → `renderThumbnails`. Deletable `.sfx-thumb-del` (styles.css:638); renumber-on-delete. Runtime-UAT confirmed multi-screenshot. |
| 3 | Sent .md records +N.png paths; host writes PNGs | ✓ VERIFIED | `card.ts` `_doSend` maps `thumbnails → screenshots[]` (404). Host `write-note.ts` decodes PNG data-URLs → `+N.png`, records in frontmatter + body. Host test "PNG data-URL decoded to +1.png with non-zero bytes" passes. UAT: 6 notes reconstructed from disk. |
| 4 | Paper aesthetic, mode header strips, no CSS bleed (shadow DOM) | ✓ VERIFIED | styles.css: free `#fefce8` (522), element `#eff6ff` (534); headers amber `#fde68a` (528) / blue `#dbeafe` (539); `.sfx-card-element` modifier wired in card.ts. `:host { all: initial }` (styles.css:15), px-only (zero rem/em font-size — sole "rem" is an explanatory comment). |
| 5 | Pins rehydrate per exact URL path; element anchored (reposition), free floating, orphaned greyed | ✓ VERIFIED | `pin.ts` `mountPins` → SW `SFX_LIST_ANNOTATIONS` → host `GET /annotations` → `listAnnotations` (path-match via `matchesUrlPath`, query ignored). `computePinPosition` (pure, imported) for anchored/free/orphaned; rAF `tick()` reposition (201). `.sfx-pin-orphaned` greyed/dashed (styles.css:697). Runtime-UAT: pins persist across reload + follow reflow. |
| 6 | Click pin → view/edit/delete; edit overwrites serial (PUT, re-marks unread); delete removes .md + +N.png (DELETE); token-gated + path-confined | ✓ VERIFIED | `pin.ts` `openPinCard` Edit→`SFX_EDIT_ANNOTATION`, Delete→`SFX_DELETE_ANNOTATION` behind inline confirm. Host `editNote` (overwrite body, status:unread, preserve frontmatter), `deleteNote` (rm .md + +N.png). Both `checkToken` first (server.ts:194,248) + `isInsideDir` confined (read-note.ts:135,184). |

**Score:** 6/6 success criteria verified

| HOST-14 | `GET /annotations` path-match, token-gated | ✓ SATISFIED | server.ts:373 + `listAnnotations`; `checkToken` (159). Route integration-tested |
| HOST-15 | `PUT /annotation/<serial>` overwrite, preserve fm, re-mark unread; path-confined, 12MB→413 | ✓ SATISFIED | server.ts:384 → `editNote`; `checkToken` + `readBody` 12MB cap → 413 (206); `isInsideDir` (135) |
| HOST-16 | `DELETE /annotation/<serial>` removes .md + +N.png; 404; path-confined | ✓ SATISFIED | server.ts:396 → `deleteNote`; `isInsideDir` per-rm (184,200); 404 via thrown statusCode |

**19/19 requirements SATISFIED. No orphaned requirements.**

### Key Link Verification (manual — tool path-resolver could not resolve `from` labels)

| From | To | Status | Detail |
|------|----|--------|--------|
| read-note.ts | security.ts isInsideDir | ✓ WIRED | import + guards on every rm/writeFile (read-note.ts:17,135,184,200) |
| server.ts handlers | security.ts checkToken | ✓ WIRED | checkToken first on GET/PUT/DELETE (server.ts:159,194,248) |
| write-note.ts | frontmatter note_position+rect | ✓ WIRED | buildFrontmatter writes both canonical keys (95,101) |
| listAnnotations | PinDescriptor.viewportCoords | ✓ WIRED | reads fm['note_position'] (read-note.ts:105) |
| card.ts | marquee.ts enterMarqueeMode | ✓ WIRED | import + call (card.ts:29,220) |
| marquee.ts | lib/marquee.ts buildMarqueeRect | ✓ WIRED | import + drag listeners (marquee.ts:19,82) |
| card.ts | lib/capture.ts trio | ✓ WIRED | captureTab/waitTwoRafs/cropToRect (card.ts:25,238–240) |
| card.ts openElementCard | .sfx-card-element CSS | ✓ WIRED | modifier applied; CSS resolves (styles.css:533) |
| index.ts onMount | pin.ts mountPins → SFX_LIST | ✓ WIRED | mountPins(container,tabId) (index.ts:114) |
| pin.ts | computePinPosition | ✓ WIRED | import + call with live rect/scroll (pin.ts:23) |
| background.ts | host GET/PUT/DELETE | ✓ WIRED | chrome.tabs.get-derived URL (background.ts:389,441,493) |
| pin.ts openPinCard | SFX_EDIT/DELETE | ✓ WIRED | relays (pin.ts:22) |
| index.ts onRemove | pin.ts teardownPins | ✓ WIRED | teardownPins() (index.ts:136) |

*The `verify.key-links` SDK query returned "Source file not found" for `from` labels because they are descriptive ("card.ts camera click"), not resolvable paths — a tool limitation, not a wiring defect. All 13 links manually confirmed present.*

### Behavioral Spot-Checks / Automated Gates

| Gate | Command | Result | Status |
|------|---------|--------|--------|
| Lib unit tests | `npm run test:lib` | 116 pass / 0 fail (23 suites) | ✓ PASS |
| Full suite (host + lib) | `npm test` | 94 pass / 1 fail (20 suites) | ⚠ ENVIRONMENTAL |

**The single failure** is `WR-06: server scans past occupied 39240 and binds to 39241` → `EADDRINUSE 127.0.0.1:39240`. The test's precondition is that 39240 is free so the scanner can be observed skipping it; the live UAT host already holds 39240. This is an environment collision, **not a code defect** (per task instruction). The port-scan logic itself is unchanged from prior phases and was not modified in Phase 6.

### Data-Flow Trace (Level 4)

| Artifact | Data | Source | Real Data | Status |
|----------|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| pin.ts pins | PinDescriptor[] | SW → GET /annotations → listAnnotations (reads .md frontmatter from disk) | Yes — UAT reconstructed 6 real notes | ✓ FLOWING |
| thumbnail strip | thumbnails[] | enterMarqueeMode → captureTab → cropToRect | Yes — real DPR-cropped pixels | ✓ FLOWING |
| pin preview img | data-URL | SW GET /screenshot relay (reads +N.png bytes → base64) | Yes — UAT thumbnails rendered | ✓ FLOWING |

### Anti-Patterns Found

None. No `TBD`/`FIXME`/`XXX` debt markers in any Phase-6 file. The single "rem" hit is an explanatory comment; the single "placeholder" hit is a legit `<textarea placeholder>` attribute. No stubs, no empty-return route handlers.

### Human Verification Required

None outstanding. All six Success Criteria were runtime-confirmed by the project owner in live Chrome UAT (2026-06-03) against host 127.0.0.1:39240. Fix commits 5c79941, 721359e, 73f4717, 31f90d2 closed the UAT findings. Treated as runtime-confirmed, not deferred.

### Gaps Summary

No gaps. All 19 requirements and all 6 ROADMAP Success Criteria are satisfied by substantive, wired code with real data flow. Pure logic (marquee math, URL-path matching, pin position, host serial-resolve/list/edit/delete) is covered by 116 passing unit tests; Chrome-runtime-bound behaviors are confirmed by human UAT. The sole test failure is an environmental port collision with the already-running UAT host, not a code defect.
