# Phase 7: review-notes Skill + Docs — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Any AI coding agent can install the review-notes skill, run it against a notes/ dir, and have it process unread notes in serial order — renaming each to *.read.md — while the README gives a developer everything needed to install and use stikfix in under 5 minutes.

**Verified:** 2026-06-03
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Skill processes notes in serial order (0001 before 0002) and renames each to *.read.md | VERIFIED | `skill/SKILL.md` Step 1 pseudocode: `unread.sort()` ascending; Step 2e renames only after fix. `selectUnread` unit-tested: `['0002-t.md','0001-t.md'] → ['0001-t.md','0002-t.md']` (131/131 pass). |
| 2 | Re-running on fully-processed dir reports "no unread notes" (idempotent) | VERIFIED | `skill/SKILL.md` Step 1: "If there are no unread notes, report 'no unread notes' and stop." `selectUnread` idempotency test: `['0001-t.read.md','0002-t.read.md'] → []`. `markReadName` guard prevents double `.read.read.md`. |
| 3 | Empty queue reports cleanly; ambiguous note flagged+unread; missing screenshot proceeds text-only | VERIFIED (automated) | `classifyNote` covers all three: `selectUnread([]) → []`; ambiguous is prose-only (D-08, `classifyNote` deliberately does not return 'ambiguous' — it is a runtime agent call); `classifyNote({status:'unread', screenshots:['x.png']}, []) → 'text-only'`. Fixture 0004 ("Make this better") and fixture 0003 (missing PNG) exercise these paths. Skill prose explicitly covers all three cases (Steps 2c, 2d). |
| 4 | Skill end-to-end: agent reads notes, applies fixes, renames processed notes, flags ambiguous (SKILL-03) | ? UNCERTAIN | Checkpoint auto-approved in chain mode. No live agent run confirmed. Automated prose-structure gate passed. HUMAN UAT required. |
| 5 | Any folder-reading AI agent can install and use skill/SKILL.md without Claude-specific frontmatter | VERIFIED | `skill/SKILL.md` has no YAML frontmatter (automated check: `!/^---/.test(s)` passed). Portable prose, no Claude-only syntax. README install section covers both Claude Code (copy to .claude/skills/) and any folder-reading agent (point directly at skill/SKILL.md). |
| 6 | README documents install + usage in under 5 minutes (5-step quickstart) | VERIFIED | `## Quickstart (< 5 minutes)` section confirmed. 5 numbered steps: build → host → load unpacked → pair token → drop notes + run skill. Host command, PowerShell variants preserved, troubleshooting section, security model, review-notes skill install. |
| 7 | CLEAN-ROOM.md confirms no GPL code present with live grep audit result; clean-room-check exits 0 | VERIFIED | `CLEAN-ROOM.md` exists (125 lines). Contains MIT provenance, clean-room narrative, banned identifier classes (by description), live PASS output captured 2026-06-03. `node scripts/clean-room-check.mjs` exits 0 in verifier run. `CLEAN-ROOM.md` listed in `SKIP_FILENAMES` — does not self-trip. |

**Score:** 6/7 truths verified (Truth 4 UNCERTAIN — human needed)

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| SKILL-01 | 07-02 | Ship skill/SKILL.md + install README that works for any folder-reading AI agent | SATISFIED | `skill/SKILL.md` exists, no frontmatter, portable. README has install section for Claude Code and any folder-reading agent. |
| SKILL-02 | 07-01, 07-02 | Skill globs notes/*.md, excludes *.read.md, sorts by serial ascending | SATISFIED | `selectUnread` unit-tested (131/131). Skill prose Step 1 matches exactly. Fixture 0099.read.md excluded by the glob rule. |
| SKILL-03 | 07-02 | For each unread note, skill reads frontmatter/body/element-context/screenshots and performs the fix | SATISFIED (automated prose gate PASS; SKILL-03 live run human-needed) | Skill prose covers all sub-steps (2a–2e). Automated structure gate confirmed presence of element-context, screenshot, flagged, text-only rules. Live end-to-end run pending human UAT. |
| SKILL-04 | 07-01, 07-02 | After handling, rename to *.read.md; re-run reports "no unread notes" | SATISFIED | `markReadName` idempotency test. `selectUnread` all-read test. Skill Step 2e: rename is last action. Skill Step 1: "no unread notes" stop condition. |
| SKILL-05 | 07-01, 07-02 | Edge cases: empty queue, ambiguous (flagged), missing screenshot (text-only) | SATISFIED | All three covered: `selectUnread([]) → []`; ambiguous prose path (D-08, classifyNote does not return 'ambiguous' — runtime agent call); `classifyNote` text-only test + prose Step 2c. Fixtures 0004 (ambiguous) and 0003 (missing PNG) present. |
| DOC-01 | 07-03 | Root README has install + usage instructions and a demo GIF | SATISFIED (demo GIF = placeholder per D-10) | README has Quickstart (<5 min), host install, extension load, token pair, skill install, trigger phrases, troubleshooting. Demo slot exists with placeholder PNG + recording instructions per D-10 locked decision. |
| DOC-02 | 07-03 | README documents clean-room MIT provenance and confirms no GPL code | SATISFIED | `CLEAN-ROOM.md` exists with full 6-part D-12 structure. README links to it. `node scripts/clean-room-check.mjs` exits 0. |

**Orphaned requirements check:** REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table maps SKILL-01..05 and DOC-01..02 to Phase 7. All 7 are accounted for in the plans. No orphaned requirements.

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `README.md` | 124–134 | "placeholder" / "demo-placeholder.png" references | Info | Intentional per locked decision D-10. `docs/demo-placeholder.png` is a committed placeholder; the README documents how to record and replace with `docs/demo.gif`. This is expected, not a defect. No TBD/FIXME/XXX markers. |

No debt markers (TBD, FIXME, XXX) found in any file modified by this phase. The "placeholder" references in README.md are intentional and self-documenting instructions per D-10.

---

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. SKILL-03 End-to-End Skill Run (from 07-HUMAN-UAT.md runbook)

**Test:** Copy `test/fixtures/notes/` to a scratch directory. Open a Claude Code (or compatible agent) session in the project root. Tell it: "Read my notes in `<scratch-dir>`". Observe the run. After completion, verify:
- `0001-20260101-120000.read.md` exists; original `.md` gone; `status: read` in frontmatter
- `0002-20260101-120001.read.md` exists; original `.md` gone; `status: read` in frontmatter
- `0003-20260101-120002.read.md` exists; original `.md` gone; `status: read` in frontmatter; agent emitted one `WARN: 0003-20260101-120002+1.png not found — proceeding text-only` line
- `0004-20260101-120003.md` still exists (NOT renamed); `status: flagged` in frontmatter; `> flagged: <reason>` blockquote in body
- `0099-20260101-120099.read.md` unchanged, not touched
Then re-run the skill on the same scratch dir; confirm it reports "no unread notes" and makes zero file changes.

**Expected:** All 6 pass criteria from the runbook met. Agent processes 4 unread notes (0001, 0002, 0003, 0004), skips 0099. Reports something like "3 fixed and marked read, 1 flagged (ambiguous)". Second run: "no unread notes".

**Why human:** SKILL-03 is an agent behavior check — the skill is prose that an AI agent follows. The correctness of the fix applied and the exact branching (flag vs proceed) depends on agent runtime behavior that cannot be deterministically verified with grep. The prose structure and rules have been verified automatically; this gate confirms the agent actually obeys them in a live run.

**Runbook:** `.planning/phases/07-review-notes-skill-docs/07-HUMAN-UAT.md`

---

### Gaps Summary

No automated gaps. All 7 must-haves that can be verified programmatically are VERIFIED. The single remaining item (SKILL-03 live end-to-end run) was a `checkpoint:human-verify` task auto-approved in GSD chain mode. It requires a human to run the skill against the fixture set and confirm outcomes. The `07-HUMAN-UAT.md` runbook provides complete step-by-step instructions.

**Phase goal assessment:** The goal artifact (skill/SKILL.md) is substantive, correct, and wired. The prose mirrors the unit-tested helpers exactly. All supporting docs (README, CLEAN-ROOM.md) are verified. The single UNCERTAIN item is the live agent runtime behavior check that was always designated as a human UAT gate.
